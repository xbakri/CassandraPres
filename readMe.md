## Cassandra Presentation

Assessment criteria for presentation (15 min. presentation incl demo, 5 min. Q&A)
1. Data model and schema (*)
• Which data model is used in the DBMS if it’s not relational? Illustrate if necessary (à demo).
• Is it necessary / possible to define a database schema or other constraints related to the
data structure? How can that be done (à demo)?
2. Consistency and Replication
• For a noSQL DBMS: How is the CAP theorem applied to the DBMS? What type of consistency
is maintained in the system? Can you choose?
• For an SQL DBMS: Is ACID fully implemented, in particular “C” & “I”? Can you choose?
• Describe how replication works in the DBMS.
3. Security and Performance
• Which security features are offered by the DBMS?
• Compare the performance of the DBMS with other DBMSs of the same and/or different
types (recent diagrams, give source, state how and what exactly was measured, be critical)
4. Specific Use Cases and Economic Information
• For which kind of use cases is the DBMS specifically good for, and why?
• Provide some economic information, e.g. market share, history, and any famous case(s).
5. Demo
• Illustrate: data model using a sample database, how to define the schema (if applicable)
• DON’T show basic crud operations (Insert/Update/Retrieve/Delete Data). Instead: Show the
query language with interesting/specific non-crud queries you execute during the demo.
